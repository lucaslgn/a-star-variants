# Running the code

In order to run the test with a specific algorithm, you're going to edit the value of the variable `algorithm` in the first lines of the _main.py_ file. Note that the possibilities of algorithms are already there, just commented.

With the algorithm and the options below in the code setted, just run the file _main.py_. For example, in the terminal, just run the command:

```sh
python main.py
```
